This codebook describes the Variables, data and transformatiosn that are used in "run_analysis.r" R-Script.

## Variables
<ul>

## Data

## Transformations

The "run_analysis.R" script is devided into 5 (+1 additional) parts.
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</il>
<li>Writes the output to file named '" run_analysis.txt"</li>
</ol>
